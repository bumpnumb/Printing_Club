# Welcome to the Printing Club!

Anyone is welcome to contribute, we love to see what fun prints all of you are printing!

**Contributions has to abide to the following rules:**
 - A new* model gets it's own directory.
 - Every print is to be accompanied with a picture of the model (Not from 3d software, real image).
 - Multi-part prints should have one parent directory with subsequent item directories.
 - The name of each directory should be short, explanatory of the print and appropriate.
 - Model directory should fit into an appropriate subdirectory.

**Contributions are not forced to but are welcome to have:**
 - A text file documenting the prints function or use case.


'*' New versions of the same 3d model should go into it's origin directory.

 
  
For example, I have printed a 1-part Raspberry pi case and a 2-part example toy, following is their correct placement:

```
.
+-- Art
+-- Electronics
|   +-- Raspberry_pi_case
|      +-- image.jpg
|      +-- raspberry_pi_case.stl
+-- Gadgets
+-- Household
+-- Tools
+-- Toys
|   +-- Example_spinning_toy
|      +-- image.jpg
|      +-- Explanation.md
|      +-- Top_part
|         +-- image.jpg
|         +-- top_part.stl
|      +-- Bottom_part
|         +-- image.jpg
|         +-- bottom_part_v2.stl
|         +-- bottom_part.stl

```

Happy printing!
