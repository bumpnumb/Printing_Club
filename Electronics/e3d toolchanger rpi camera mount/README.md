This is a small mount for a raspberry pi + camera v2 that fits on the e3d toolchanger.
Will fit on any extrusion with 8mm spacing.


Do not mount pi untill after the mount_rear is fastened on the extrusion, screws cannot be accesed after pi is mounted.
Links can be printed if camera needs to be further extended, do note the length of pi camera bus cable.
